# Task 4 – Optimization using PuLP (CodTech Data Science Internship)

## 📌 Description:
This task involves solving a **Linear Programming (LP)** problem using the `PuLP` library in Python.  
We are tasked with maximizing profit from the production of two products while adhering to material and labor constraints.

---

## ✅ Problem Statement:

A factory produces two products:
- **Product A**: ₹20 profit per unit
- **Product B**: ₹30 profit per unit

### Constraints:
- Each unit of A requires:
  - 2 units of material
  - 3 units of labor
- Each unit of B requires:
  - 4 units of material
  - 2 units of labor
- Available:
  - 100 units of material
  - 90 units of labor

---

## 🧠 Objective:
**Maximize** the total profit:
Profit = 20A + 30B

---

## 🧰 Tools Used:
- Python
- PuLP library for linear optimization

---

## 📁 Files Included:
- `task4_optimization_pulp.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full optimization solution
- `README.md`: Explanation of the problem, method, and results

---

## 🔎 Output:
- Optimal number of Product A to produce
- Optimal number of Product B to produce
- ✅ **Maximum Profit achieved**
