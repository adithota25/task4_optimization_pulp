Task 4 – PuLP Optimization Output

📌 Problem Summary:
- Maximize Profit = 20A + 30B
- Constraints:
  - Material: 2A + 4B ≤ 100
  - Labor:    3A + 2B ≤ 90

✅ Optimal Solution (from PuLP Solver):
- Status: Optimal
- Product A to produce: 15 units
- Product B to produce: 17 units
- Maximum Profit: ₹810

🧠 Interpretation:
- Produce 15 units of Product A
- Produce 17 units of Product B
- This yields a total profit of ₹810
- Resources used:
  - Material used: 98 units (within 100)
  - Labor used: 79 units (within 90)

✔️ Both constraints satisfied — solution is optimal.
